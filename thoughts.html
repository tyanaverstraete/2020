    THE MEMORY <br>
    The thought process

    <br>

    Every memory has its authenticity. They can be blurry; sometimes black like a dream, other
    moments they are clear. Just as the body subconsciously remembers and analyses movements,
    we do this psychologically with the brain.When one is traumatised, our subconscious mind
    blocks it because it is too painful by the emotions that are linked to it.
    <br>
    <br>

    Numerous memories float in my mind about body and water. Shapes arise colourful, layered
    and abstract, solitary with each other. Time passes, the solid form melts away and what
    was once forgotten appears. In a slow process, the memory melts away, like a shape in ice.
    What remains is a thin residue, brittle as glass.The viewer sees a snapshot, an own
    interpretation of what it is, was or can be. Heat, light and reflections encourage movement
    of the form. Slowly, the dance of what was once frozen comes alive, dripping softly leaving its

    The brain hippocampus supervises our memories along with the prefrontal cortex. It breaks
    down each memory into fragments that are categorised. As a visual map that forms the
    network of memories. In this way, personal events are part of episodic memory.
    <br>
    <br>

    The hippocampus can be compared to a menu full of imaginary scenarios that are generated.
    Where other brain parts that associate scenarios with past experiences or with a threat.
    To be able to make a well-founded conclusion in combination with the current physical and
    psychological state.The prefrontal cortex here has the ability to link cognitive and emotional
    functions to what occurs in the hippocampus. The function of the hippocampus is not limited to
    just creating and retrieving memories, and creating spatial maps. It is supported by place cells
    - specific neurons that create and hold several related scenarios for a longer period of time.
    A significant part of its function results in the creation of an imaginary bridge between the past and the future - the now.
    <br>
    <br>

    Many memories fade with time. Some after a few minutes others remain months, years or lifelong.
    What is the reason that certain memories remain and others don’t?
    <br>
    <br>

    A study with rats shows that in threatening situations with an anxiety response such as
    a freeze response occurs. There is an increase in myelin, which maintains the long-term
    anxiety response. Myelin is an insulating layer around the foothills of the brain cells.
    The increase in this ensures a neutral transmission in the brain that becomes more efficient,
    resulting in a long-lasting fear memory.

    Something closely connected in everything we do. Emotion links all our senses to both good and
    bad memories. They arise from image, speech, hearing, smell, feelings and conclusions. For example,
    we would have had an emotional memory since birth. We cannot remember anything visually from the
    first three years of life, but we can remember it emotionally. It is one of the strongest forms of
    memory and is best remembered by the brain. Not everyone has an equally evolved emotional memory.<br>

    In addition to the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, we also have to deal with the amygdala in
    our brains. The part of our brain that deals with memories of emotions. This indicates that short and
    long term memories do not develop simultaneously in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Instead,
    they transferred to the cerebral cortex. A study claims that neurons function like thinking cells, which
    have the ability to look back at certain memories that were previously selected. The amygdala is responsible
    for giving more or less attention to a memory, based on the associated emotions. The stimulus from where the
    focus is on the deeper underlying memory will bring some influence.  As follow, if the hippocampus no longer
    works and does not allow the storage of certain memories, this subcortical area is able to retain a certain
    emotional memory of that situation. It has a protective function. This kind of memory is what allows us to
    remember things that we have associated with positive or negative proceedings.

    Color something mysterious and inexplicable. How do we remember color and can we remember color?
    There are no direct scientific articles on this matter. Nevertheless, colours have certain meanings
    and characteristics depending on which culture and continent one lives in. Can this then have a certain
    influence on our memory?
    <br>
    <br>
    When you rub your eyes with a little pressure of your hands, you can see balls of color appear as above,
    partly because of the pressure you apply on the eyelid. Now imagine that we remember color in those shades.
    Color and patterns are on of the first data that stores our memory to the bigger picture, but it is the details
    that we remember last. Our brain is still a bit strange. It works backwards.
